*Monitoring* - We believe the connectivity issues are being caused by an isolated ISP issue. We've had reports that swapping to Google DNS servers (see here; https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using) resolves the problem for users. {{< track "2018-05-25 04:40:00" >}}\

*Investigating* - We're aware of reports that users are experiencing connection issues on the East coast of the United States. We're currently investigating these issues, and apologize for any inconvenience it may be causing you. {{< track "2018-05-25 04:13:00" >}}
